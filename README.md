# 🛍️ Retail Store Sales Analysis

This project involves cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing a retail store's transaction dataset using Python's Pandas and Matplotlib libraries. The goal is to derive business insights from sales data, such as identifying top customers, popular items, and trends in payment methods.

## 📂 Project Structure

- `data.xlsx`: Raw dataset (as received)
- `cleaned_data.xlsx`: Final, cleaned version after handling missing values and formatting
- `STORE_EDA.py`: Complete Python script for data cleaning, exploration, and visualization
- `.png` files: Visual charts saved as part of the analysis (optional for GitHub preview)

## 📊 Key Analysis Tasks Performed

### ✅ Data Cleaning:
- Converted `Transaction Date` to datetime format
- Handled missing values with median and mode strategies
- Removed duplicate transactions
